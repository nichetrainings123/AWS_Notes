🧠 AWS Load Balancer Notes
🔹 Definition

A Load Balancer (LB) in AWS automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers, IPs, Lambda functions) in one or more Availability Zones.
It increases availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

⚙️ Types of AWS Load Balancers (Under Elastic Load Balancing - ELB)
Type	Purpose	Layer	Protocol Support	Target Types	Routing Logic	Scope	Pricing Model
1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)	Used for HTTP/HTTPS (web traffic). Ideal for microservices, containers.	Layer 7 (Application Layer)	HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC	Instance, IP, Lambda	Content-based routing (Host, Path, Header, Query)	Regional	Charged per LCU (Load Balancer Capacity Unit) + hours
2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)	Used for high-performance, low-latency TCP/UDP traffic.	Layer 4 (Transport Layer)	TCP, UDP, TLS	Instance, IP, ALB	Connection-based routing	Regional	Charged per NLCU (Network Load Balancer Capacity Unit) + hours
3. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)	Used for deploying, scaling, and managing third-party network appliances (firewalls, IDS/IPS).	Layer 3 (Network Layer)	IP (GENEVE protocol)	Appliance Targets (Virtual Appliances)	Routes via GENEVE encapsulation	Regional	Charged per Gateway LCU + data processing
4. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)	Legacy load balancer supporting both Layer 4 and Layer 7.	Layer 4 & 7	HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL	Instance	Basic routing	Regional	Charged per hour + data processed
🧩 Key Differences Summary
Feature	ALB	NLB	GWLB	CLB
Layer	7 (Application)	4 (Transport)	3 (Network)	4 & 7
Use Case	Web traffic, microservices	TCP/UDP, real-time apps	Security appliances	Legacy applications
Routing	Content-based (Path/Host)	Connection-based	Packet-based	Basic
Protocol	HTTP, HTTPS	TCP, UDP, TLS	IP (GENEVE)	HTTP, TCP
Health Checks	HTTP/HTTPS	TCP/HTTP/HTTPS	GENEVE	TCP/HTTP
Targets	EC2, IP, Lambda	EC2, IP, ALB	Virtual Appliances	EC2 only
Performance	Moderate	Ultra-high	Depends on appliances	Moderate
Cross-Zone Load Balancing	Optional	Optional	Not Supported	Enabled
Pricing	Per LCU-hour	Per NLCU-hour	Per GLBU-hour	Per hour
Modern Usage	✅ Recommended	✅ Recommended	✅ Specialized	❌ Deprecated
💡 Use Case Examples
Scenario	Recommended LB	Reason
Web app using HTTP/HTTPS	ALB	Layer 7 intelligent routing
Real-time gaming or chat apps	NLB	Handles TCP/UDP high performance
Network firewall or IDS integration	GWLB	Integrates virtual appliances
Old legacy EC2 apps	CLB	For backward compatibility
🌍 Scope (Regional vs Global)
Load Balancer Type	Scope
Application Load Balancer	Regional
Network Load Balancer	Regional
Gateway Load Balancer	Regional
Classic Load Balancer	Regional
Global Accelerator (not LB but often confused)	Global (uses anycast for global routing)
💰 Pricing Overview (Simplified)
Load Balancer	Pricing Metric	Typical Cost Structure
ALB	per hour + per LCU-hour	~$0.0225/hr + LCU usage
NLB	per hour + per NLCU-hour	~$0.0225/hr + NLCU usage
GWLB	per hour + per GLBU-hour + data	~$0.025/hr + processing
CLB	per hour + data processed	~$0.025/hr + $0.008/GB
🧱 Important Components

Listeners → Define how LB receives traffic (port/protocol).

Target Groups → Group of registered targets (EC2, IP, Lambda).

Rules → Conditions for routing (path, host, header, etc.).

Health Checks → Periodic checks to ensure target availability.

Security Groups → Control inbound/outbound traffic.

🧰 Example: ALB Setup Steps

Create or choose a VPC and subnets (at least 2 AZs).

Create Target Groups (EC2 or Lambda).

Configure Listeners and Rules (HTTP/HTTPS).

Add Security Group for LB.

Review and Launch the ALB.

Test with DNS name assigned by AWS.
