In IT, storage refers to the technology, systems, and methods used to save digital data (files, applications, databases, backups) so it can be retrieved and used later.
Types of Storage
Primary Storage (Volatile)
Fast, temporary memory.
Example: RAM (Random Access Memory)
Loses data when power is off.
Secondary Storage (Non-volatile)
Long-term data storage.
Examples: Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), Solid State Drives (SSDs), Optical Discs, USB drives
Tertiary Storage
Used mainly for backup/archival.
Example: Tape drives, Blu-ray discs


companies and data centers, storage is more advanced than just a hard disk:
DAS (Direct Attached Storage)
Storage directly attached to a server.
Example: internal HDD/SSD in your laptop.
NAS (Network Attached Storage)
Dedicated storage device connected to a network.
Multiple users/computers access files over the network.
SAN (Storage Area Network)
High-speed network dedicated to connecting servers with storage.
Used in enterprise for databases, virtualization, large workloads.
Cloud Storage
Data stored in remote data centers and accessed via the internet.
Examples: AWS S3, Google Drive, Azure Blob Storage.


Type of storage in architecture 
File storage Data is stored as files in a hierarchical structure (folders, subfolders, filenames).
Access method:You access it the way you do on your PC: folder → file.txt.
Use cases:
Shared drives for users
Content management
Home directories
Examples:
Network Attached Storage (NAS)
NFS (Network File System), SMB/CIFS (Windows file sharing)
✅ Good for: simple file sharing, small/medium workloads.❌ Not great for: high-performance databases.

3. Object Storage
How it works:Data stored as objects → each object = data + metadata + unique ID.
No folders; instead, it uses a flat structure in a storage pool.
Access method:Access via APIs/HTTP (e.g., GET/PUT requests).
Use cases:
Storing images, videos, backups, logs, big data
Cloud apps at massive scale
Examples:
AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage
On-prem: OpenStack Swift, MinIO
✅ Good for: scalability, unstructured data, backups.❌ Not ideal for: transactional workloads (like databases).

 Block Storage
How it works:Data is split into fixed-size chunks called blocks.Each block has an address but no metadata → OS assembles them into a file system.
Access method:Like a raw disk (e.g., /dev/sda in Linux).
Use cases:
Databases (Oracle, SQL, MongoDB)
Virtual machines (VM disk images)
Transactional workloads
Examples:
Storage Area Network (SAN)
Cloud block storage: AWS EBS, Azure Managed Disks, GCP Persistent Disks
✅ Good for: high IOPS, low latency.

Managed Storage Definition:, durability, patching, backups — you just use the storage.
What you do:Create buckets/volumes/tables → start storing data. No need to manage the underlying disks or servers.
Examples in AWS:
Amazon S3 (Object storage) → AWS handles scaling, replication across AZs.
Amazon EFS (Managed file system) → elastic, scales automatically.
Amazon FSx (managed file storage for Windows/Lustre).
Amazon RDS storage → block storage fully managed by AWS for databases.
✅ Pros:
No infra management needed.
Built-in HA (High Availability) and durability.
Automatic scaling (S3, EFS).
Ideal for teams focusing on app logic, not infra.
❌ Cons:
Less control over performance tuning.
Slightly higher cost (because AWS manages for you).


Unmanaged Storage (You manage it)
Definition:AWS just gives you raw storage volumes. You must manage filesystem, scaling, replication, backup, patching.
What you do:Mount it, format it, configure RAID/replication, manage performance.
Examples in AWS:
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) → raw block storage attached to EC2.
Instance Store (Ephemeral storage) → storage physically attached to EC2 host.
Self-managed file servers on EC2 (you install NFS, Samba, etc. yourself).
✅ Pros:
Full control (file system, caching, RAID, backup strategy).
Can be cheaper at scale if you optimize well.
Better for custom workloads with specific tuning needs.
❌ Cons:
You must manage scaling, snapshots, durability, availability.
If the EC2 or AZ goes down, your data may be at risk (unless you handle replication).
