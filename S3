Amazon S3 Storage Classes
Storage Class	Durability	Availability SLA	Availability Zones	Retrieval Time	Best Use Case	Definition
S3 Standard	99.999999999% (11 9’s)	99.9%	≥ 3 AZs	Milliseconds	Frequently accessed data (websites, apps, analytics, ML)	Default storage class designed for high durability, availability, and low latency access.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering	99.999999999%	99.9%	≥ 3 AZs	Milliseconds	Unknown/variable access patterns (auto cost optimization)	Automatically moves data between frequent and infrequent access tiers to optimize cost.
S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)	99.999999999%	99.9%	≥ 3 AZs	Milliseconds	Long-lived but less frequently accessed data (backups, DR)	Lower-cost option for data accessed less often but still requiring rapid retrieval.
S3 One Zone-IA	99.999999999%	99.9%	1 AZ	Milliseconds	Re-creatable infrequent data, lower cost than Standard-IA	Stores data in a single AZ at reduced cost; suitable for non-critical or easily reproducible data.
S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval	99.999999999%	99.9%	≥ 3 AZs	Milliseconds	Archival with instant retrieval (medical images, compliance)	Archive storage with the lowest-cost option for data needing immediate access.
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Glacier)	99.999999999%	99.9%	≥ 3 AZs	Minutes (expedited), hours (standard/bulk)	Archive with occasional retrieval (media archives, logs)	Low-cost archival storage with flexible retrieval options from minutes to hours.
S3 Glacier Deep Archive	99.999999999%	99.9%	≥ 3 AZs	12–48 hours	Lowest-cost storage, long-term archive (regulatory, compliance)	Cheapest S3 option, designed for data that is rarely accessed but must be retained for years.
S3 Outposts	99.999999999%	99.9%	On-Premises Outpost	Milliseconds	On-prem S3 storage for hybrid workloads	Brings S3 to on-premises via AWS Outposts, keeping data close to applications with local processing needs.
S3 Express One Zone (new)	99.999999999%	99.9%	1 AZ	Sub-millisecond	High-performance, single AZ workloads (AI/ML training, analytics)	Designed for extremely low-latency, high-throughput workloads within a single AZ.
